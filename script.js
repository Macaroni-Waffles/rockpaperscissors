/*Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

    Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
    Account for TIES by re-playing the round.*/
